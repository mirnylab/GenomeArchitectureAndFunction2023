# GenomeArchitectureAndFunction2023

Welcome to "What we see in Hi-C?" workshop at Genome Architecture and Function 2023 Summer School!

This is a two-part intro to Hi-C data analysis: 

- Part I covers qualitative Hi-C data analysis in interactive browsers (higlass, resgen)
- Part II shows how to use flexibility of Python programming for whole-genome, compartments, TADs and scalilng analysis of Hi-C with [Open2C tools](https://github.com/open2c).

Disclaimer: although we formally refer to whole-genome chromosome capture data as Hi-C, we will mostly work with Micro-C here. 

To start, follow the instructions in [What_we_see_in_Hi-C_4Jun2023 notebook](https://github.com/mirnylab/GenomeArchitectureAndFunction2023/blob/main/What_we_see_in_Hi-C_4Jun2023.ipynb).
